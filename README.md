# Trajectory-Tracking-for-SCARA-Robot-with-Unknown-Mass-of-Link-using-Adaptive-Slotine-Controller
A robot arm with 4 links and 4 degrees of freedom (4-DOF) with unknown links is controlled to track any desired path defined in the task space using an indirect adaptive Slotine controller estimating unknown masses and tracks the desired trajectories defined in the task space.
